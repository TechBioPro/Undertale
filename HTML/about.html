            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>Undertale is a role-playing video game created by American indie developer Toby Fox.</p>
            <p>The player controls a child who has fallen into the Underground: a large, secluded region under the surface of the Earth,</p>
            <p>separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during the journey back to the surface. Some monsters might engage the player in a fight.</p>
            <p>The combat system involves the player navigating through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent. They can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in</p>
            <p>order to spare them instead of killing them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes. </p>
