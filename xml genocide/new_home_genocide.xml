        <p>First Meeting</p>
        <p>Greetings.</p>
        <p>I am Chara. </p>
        <p>Thank you. </p>
        <p>Your power awakened me from death. </p>
        <p>My “human soul.”</p>
        <p>My “determination.”</p>
        <p>They were not mine, but YOURS.</p>
        <p>At first, I was so confused. </p>
        <p>Our plan had failed, hadn’t it?</p>
        <p>Why was I brought back to life?</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>You.</p>
        <p>With you guidance. </p>
        <p>I realized the purpose of my reincarnation. </p>
        <p>Power. </p>
        <p>Together, we eradicate the enemy and became strong. </p>
        <p>HP. ATK. DEF. GOLD. EXP. LV. </p>
        <p>Every time a number increases, that feeling…</p>
        <p>That’s me. </p>
        <p>“Chara.”</p>
        <p>Now. </p>
        <p>Now, we have reached the absolute. </p>
        <p>There is nothing left for us here. </p>
        <p>Let us erase this pointless world, and move on to the next. </p>
                <decision type="erase">ERASE</decision>
                <decision type="dont">DO NOT</decision>
                    <response convo="erase">Erase</response>
        <p>Right. You are a great partner. </p>
        <p>We’ll be together forever, won’t we?</p>
                    <response convo="dont">Do Not</response>
        <p>No…?</p>
        <p>Hmm…</p>
        <p>How curious.</p>
        <p>You must have misunderstood. </p>
        <p>SINCE WHEN WERE YOU THE ONE IN CONTROL?</p>
        <p>Second Meeting</p>
        <p>Greetings.</p>
        <p>I am Chara. </p>
        <p>“Chara.”</p>
        <p>The demon that comes when people call its name. </p>
        <p>It doesn’t matter when.</p>
        <p>It doesn’t matter where. </p>
        <p>Time after time, I will appear. </p>
        <p>And, with your help.</p>
        <p>We will eradicate the enemy and become strong. </p>
        <p>HP. ATK. DEF. GOLD. EXP. LV. </p>
        <p>Every time a number increases, that feeling… </p>
        <p>That’s me. </p>
        <p>“Chara.”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>But. </p>
        <p>You and I are not the same, are we?</p>
        <p>This SOUL resonates with a strange feeling. </p>
        <p>There is a reason you continue to recreate this world. </p>
        <p>There is a reason you continue to destroy it. </p>
        <p>You.</p>
        <p>You are wracked with a perverted sentimentality. </p>
        <p>Hmm. </p>
        <p>I cannot understand these feelings any more. </p>
        <p>Despite this. </p>
        <p>I feel obligated to suggest. </p>
        <p>Should you choose to create this world once more. </p>
        <p>Another path would be better suited. </p>
        <p>Now, partner. </p>
        <p>Let us send this world back into the abyss. </p>
                <decision type="erase">ERASE </decision>
                <decision type="dont">DO NOT </decision>
                    <response convo="erase">Erase</response>
        <p>Right. You are a great partner. </p>
        <p>We’ll be together forever, won’t we?</p>
                    <response convo="dont">Do Not</response>
        <p>No…?</p>
        <p>Hmm…</p>
        <p>This feeling you have. </p>
        <p>This is what I spoke of. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, regarding this…</p>
        <p>YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE LONG AGO.</p>
    </chara>
    <location n="12">Abyss </location>
               <decision>You Want To Go Back</decision>
    <p>Interesting. </p>
    <p>You want to go back. </p>
    <p>You want to go back to the world you destroyed. </p>
    <p>It was you who pushed everything to its edge. </p>
    <p>It was you who led the world to its destruction. </p>
    <p>But you cannot accept it. </p>
    <p>You think you are above consequences.</p>
              <decision type="yes">YES </decision>
              <decision type="no">NO</decision>
                  <response convo="yes">Yes.</response>
    <p>Exactly</p>
                  <response convo="no">No. </response>
    <p>Then what are you looking for?</p>
    <p>Perhaps.</p>
    <p>We can reach a compromise. </p>
    <p>You still have something I want. </p>
    <p>Give it to me. </p>
    <p>And I will bring this world back. </p>
              <decision type="yes">YES </decision>
              <decision type="no">NO</decision>
                  <response convo="yes">Yes </response>
    <p>Then it is agreed. </p>
                  <response convo="no">No</response>
    <p>Then stay here for all eternity. </p>
    <p>You will give me your SOUL.</p>
              <decision type="yes">YES </decision>
              <decision type="no">NO</decision>
                  <response convo="yes">Yes</response>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>Then, it is done. </p>
                  <response convo="no">No</response>
    <p>Then stay here for all eternity. </p>
