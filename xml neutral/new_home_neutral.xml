        <p>*So you finally made it. </p>
        <p>*The end of your journey is at hand. </p>
        <p>*In a few moments, you will meet the king.</p>
        <p>*Together… </p>
        <p>*You will determine the future of this world. </p>
        <p>*That’s then. </p>
        <p>*Now. </p>
        <p>*You will be judged.</p>
        <p>*You will be judged for your every action. </p>
        <p>*You will be judged for every EXP you’ve earned. </p>
        <p>*What’s EXP?</p>
        <p>*It’s an acronym.</p>
        <p>*It stands for “execution points.”</p>
        <p>*A way of quantifying the pain you have inflicted on others. </p>
        <p>*When you kill someone, your EXP increases. </p>
        <p>*When you have enough EXP, you LOVE increases. </p>
        <p>*LOVE, too, is an acronym. </p>
        <p>*It stands for “Level of Violence.”</p>
        <p>*A way of measuring someone’s capacity to hurt. </p>
        <p>*The more you kill, the easier it becomes to distance yourself. </p>
        <p>*The more you distance yourself, the less you will hurt. </p>
        <p>*The more easily you can bring yourself to hurt others. </p>
        <p>*Now you understand. </p>
        <p>*It’s time to begin your judgment. </p>
        <p>*Look inside yourself.</p>
        <p>*Have you really done the right thing?</p>
        <p>*And, considering what you’ve done… </p>
        <p>*What will you do now?</p>
        <p>*Take a moment to think about this. </p>
        <p>*…</p>
        <p>*Truthfully, it doesn’t really matter what you said. </p>
        <p>*all that’s important is that you were honest with yourself. </p>

        <p>*though</p>
        <p>*one thing about you always struck me as kinda odd.</p>

        <p>*you were thrown into those situations against your will</p>
        <p>*but</p>
        <p>*sometimes…</p>

        <p>*this is an odd thing to say, but…</p>
