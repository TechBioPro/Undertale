    <TorielsRoom n="02" p="3">* (But now, you realize it's actually one size bigger than a double.)</TorielsRoom>
    <TorielsRoom n="02" p="4">* It's not like this cactus was waiting for you to come back or anything...</TorielsRoom>

    <FroggitNearToyKnife n="05" p="4">*(... let's just take this one step at a time, OK?)</FroggitNearToyKnife>

    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="1">* Don't worry about me.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="2">* Someone has to take care of these flowers.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="3">* Frisk, please leave me alone.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="4">* I can't come back. * I just can't, OK?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="5">* I don't want to break their hearts all over again.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="6">* It's better if they never see me.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="7">* ... why are you still here?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="8">* Are you trying to keep me company?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="9">* Frisk...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="10">* ...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="11">* Hey.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="12">* Let me ask you a question.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="13">* Frisk... * Why did you come here?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="14">* Everyone knows the legend, right...?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="15">* "Travellers who climb Mt. Ebott are said to disappear."</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="16">* ...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="17">* Frisk.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="18">* Why would you ever climb a mountain like that?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="19">* Was it foolishness?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="20">* Was it fate?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="21">* Or was it... * Because you...?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="22">* Well.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="23">* Only you know the answer, don't you...?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="24">* I know why Chara climbed the mountain.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="25">* It wasn't for a very happy reason.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="26">* Frisk. * I'll be honest with you.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="27">* Chara hated humanity.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="28">* Why htey did, they never talked about it.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="29">* But they felt very strongly about that.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="30">* Frisk... * You really ARE different from Chara.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="31">* In fact, though you have similar, uh, fashion choices...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="32">* I don't know why I ever acted like you were the same person.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="33">* Maybe... * The truth is...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="34">* Chara wasn't really the greatest person.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="35">* While, Frisk...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="36">* You're the type of friend I wish I always had.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="37">* So maybe I was kind of projecting a little bit.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="38">* Let's be honest * I did some weird stuff as a flower.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="39">* There's one last thing I feel like I should tell you.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="40">* Frisk, when Chara and I combined our SOULs together...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="41">* The control over our body was actually split between us.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="42">* They were the one that picked up their own empty body.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="43">* And then, when we got to the village...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="44">* They were the one that wanted to...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="45">* ... to use our full power.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="46">* I was the one that resisted.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="47">* And then, because of me, we...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="48">* Well, that's why I ended up a flower.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="49">* Frisk...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="50">* This whole time, I've blamed myself for that decision.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="51">* That's why I adopted that horrible view of the world</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="52">* "Kill or be killed."</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="53">* But now... * After meeting you...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="54">* Frisk, I don't regret that decision anymore.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="55">* I did the right thing.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="56">* If I killed those humans...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="57">* We would have had to wage war against all of humanity.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="58">* And in the end, everyone went free, right?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="59">* I sitll feel kind of sad knowing how long it took...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="60">* ... so maybe it wasn't a perfect decision.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="61">* But you can't regret hard choices your whole life, right?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="62">* Well, not that I have much of a life left.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="63">* But that's besides the point.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="64">* Frisk, thank you for listening to me.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="65">* You should really go be with your friends now, OK?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="66">* Oh, and, please...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="67">* In the future, if you uh, see me...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="68">* Don't think of it as me, OK?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="69">* I just want you to remember me like this.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="70">* Someone that was your friend for a little while.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="71">* Oh, and Frisk...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="72">* Be careful in the outside world, OK?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="73">* Despite what everyone thinks, it's not as nice as it is here.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="74">* There are a lot of Floweys out there.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="75">* And not everything can be resolved by just being nice.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="76">* Frisk...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="77">* Don't kill, and don't be killed alright?</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="78">* That's the best you can strive for.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="79">* Well, see you.</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="80">* Frisk...</GoldenFlowers>
    <GoldenFlowers n="10" p="81">* Don't you have anything better to do?</GoldenFlowers>
