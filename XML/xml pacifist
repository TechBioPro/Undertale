    <p map="Ruins" place="TorielsRoom" n="02" pg="3">* (But now, you realize it's actually one size bigger than a double.)</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="TorielsRoom" n="02" pg="4">* It's not like this cactus was waiting for you to come back or anything...</p>

    <p map="Ruins" place="FroggitNearToyKnife" n="05" pg="4">*(... let's just take this one step at a time, OK?)</p>

    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="3">* Frisk, please leave me alone.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="4">* I can't come back. * I just can't, OK?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="5">* I don't want to break their hearts all over again.</p>

    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="9">* Frisk...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="10">* ...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="11">* Hey.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="12">* Let me ask you a question.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="13">* Frisk... * Why did you come here?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="14">* Everyone knows the legend, right...?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="15">* "Travellers who climb Mt. Ebott are said to disappear."</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="16">* ...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="17">* Frisk.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="18">* Why would you ever climb a mountain like that?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="19">* Was it foolishness?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="20">* Was it fate?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="21">* Or was it... * Because you...?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="22">* Well.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="23">* Only you know the answer, don't you...?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="24">* I know why Chara climbed the mountain.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="25">* It wasn't for a very happy reason.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="26">* Frisk. * I'll be honest with you.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="27">* Chara hated humanity.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="28">* Why htey did, they never talked about it.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="29">* But they felt very strongly about that.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="30">* Frisk... * You really ARE different from Chara.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="31">* In fact, though you have similar, uh, fashion choices...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="32">* I don't know why I ever acted like you were the same person.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="33">* Maybe... * The truth is...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="34">* Chara wasn't really the greatest person.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="35">* While, Frisk...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="36">* You're the type of friend I wish I always had.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="37">* So maybe I was kind of projecting a little bit.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="38">* Let's be honest * I did some weird stuff as a flower.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="39">* There's one last thing I feel like I should tell you.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="40">* Frisk, when Chara and I combined our SOULs together...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="41">* The control over our body was actually split between us.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="42">* They were the one that picked up their own empty body.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="43">* And then, when we got to the village...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="44">* They were the one that wanted to...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="45">* ... to use our full power.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="46">* I was the one that resisted.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="47">* And then, because of me, we...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="48">* Well, that's why I ended up a flower.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="49">* Frisk...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="50">* This whole time, I've blamed myself for that decision.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="51">* That's why I adopted that horrible view of the world</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="52">* "Kill or be killed."</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="53">* But now... * After meeting you...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="54">* Frisk, I don't regret that decision anymore.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="55">* I did the right thing.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="56">* If I killed those humans...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="57">* We would have had to wage war against all of humanity.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="58">* And in the end, everyone went free, right?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="59">* I sitll feel kind of sad knowing how long it took...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="60">* ... so maybe it wasn't a perfect decision.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="61">* But you can't regret hard choices your whole life, right?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="62">* Well, not that I have much of a life left.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="63">* But that's besides the point.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="64">* Frisk, thank you for listening to me.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="65">* You should really go be with your friends now, OK?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="66">* Oh, and, please...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="67">* In the future, if you uh, see me...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" pg="68">* Don't think of it as me, OK?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" pg="69">* I just want you to remember me like this.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="70">* Someone that was your friend for a little while.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="71">* Oh, and Frisk...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="72">* Be careful in the outside world, OK?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="73">* Despite what everyone thinks, it's not as nice as it is here.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="74">* There are a lot of Floweys out there.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="75">* And not everything can be resolved by just being nice.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="76">* Frisk...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="77">* Don't kill, and don't be killed alright?</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="78">* That's the best you can strive for.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="79">* Well, see you.</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="80">* Frisk...</p>
    <p map="Ruins" place="GoldenFlowers" n="10" pg="81">* Don't you have anything better to do?</p>
