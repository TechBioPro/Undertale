# 2019-10-07 ebb: SepiaTonedMemories is an awfully long name for an attribute! Is it always associated with the beginning sequence, 
# or what role do they have in the game?
# I'm just wondering if it makes more sense for it to be an attribute value instead of a name, like this:
# the attribute to be start="SepiaTonedMemories"  or begin="SepiaTonedMemories"? Alternatively, if you see those sepia toned memories in 
# places other than the Intro segment, and they're special (nothing like them), you could abbreviate this attribute name so there's less typing:
# STM="start" STM="end" 
SepiaTonedMemories = attribute SepiaTonedMemories {text}
# Should SepiaTonedMemories be an attribute, or the value of an attribute? 
title = element title {text}
p = element p {(n | text)*}
# ebb: Do you want the <p> elements to contain any markup? For this, you would only ever have zero or one n attribute, and 
# probably you want to make it required. (Also, you can go in and have the computer automatically add paragraph numbers later, so you don't really
# need to hand-code them: you could probably remove the n.) Try:
# p = element p {text}
# or p = element p {mixed{(element1 | element2 | element3)*}} if you want to have a few elements available for marking up interesting things in paragraphs

# ebb: Here you want to be using mixed{} in your content model. (What you have here does works too, 
# but this situation with elements showing up anywhere around text
# is what mixed{} was designed to handle.
# instruction = element instruction {mixed{(command | GameOver)*}}
command = element command {(text | Confirm | Cancel | In-GameMenu | Fullscreen | Quit | GameOver)*}
# ebb: Here too, you can be using the mixed{} syntax to describe what's happening, text floating anywhere around these elements.
